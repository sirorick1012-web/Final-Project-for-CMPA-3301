# Retrospective

This is my highs and low per sey. I have fun doing this project, even though it has been a rough go of it this time. Let's dive into it.
  
  ### The good
     1. New tools to use (GitHub, MarkDown)
	 2. External Css instead of InLine
	 3. Refresher
	 
I love getting to use GitHub. It has been a great place for all your work to reside in. Makes things a lot easier.
MarkDown is a tool that i will start using going forward in my career. Keeps thoughts and plans very structured.
External Css has been neat to do. I am used to in line so i naver had to make sure css and html was in the same folder. And this is a reason that you will see external in the hard list lol.
It has been nice to build a webpage again, its been a while since i have had to do this and it has been fun.

### The BAD
   1. External Css
   2. Time.
   
    These were the two things i struggled with the most. Working full time running an IT department for a division takes most of my time. Having to concentrate on a webpage was a lot harder than i thought it would be.
	External Css was a pain because i use One Drive and you cannot have your html and css in a file in OneDrive because OneDrive is a private folder and you would have to make it public in order for the website to open correctly.
	Inline is much eaiser for that reason alone for me.
	
	### Moving forwardGoing forward, I have to find a way to make more time to spend on projects so that i can showcase my skills(not that i need to). I also will starrt making more time for school and work. Have to find a happy meduim for both.I will start using MarkDown and GitHub more and become more familure with external css.
	This course has been an eye opener on how complacent we can become if we do not use the tolls and knowledge that we have learned. We must also be open to change and trying new ways, not just relying on "this is how we did it in the past" mentality.
