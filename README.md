Final Project!

This is the final project for class. I will be making a two page website on GitHub to show off my personal skills on what we have learned in class. If all goes well, you will have a walkthrough for creating a simple, basic active directory for a company.  We will look at the following:
 1. the main directory
 2. group policy
 3. orginazational units
 4. FMG
 5. security groups
 
While there are more complex ways to create an Active Directory, I would like to focus on the simple walkthough so that anyone who. looks at this will be able to create an Active Directory!
